# Level Based Persona and Segmentation


My aim in this project is to obtain information about the customers in the
dataset and their purchases, divide them into certain levels, and apply persona.
It would be more appropriate to use the demographic information provided by the
dataset while applying these procedures. After creating the persona groups using
demographic data, we will be able to predict which persona group they are in
 when we obtain new customer data in the future.

First, letâ€™s get to know our data sets.
**Users Dataset** contains user id (uid), day of registration (reg_date),
 device (device), gender (gender), country (country) and age (age) variables.

**Purchase Dataset** shows the date of purchase (date), user id (uid),
and the amount spent (purchase).

You can look at my [Medium page](https://medium.com/ogi-on-ds/level-based-persona-cf1bcb708b70) for detailed explanation.
